   - Development Round (5/28 ~ 6/19):
     - Six finalists (individuals or teams) will develop their ideas. We will try our bests to ship the development kit, however you are expected to start development even before really handing in an Aroma Shooter.
     - Aroma Shooters are controlled through the internet using AWS IoT of which SDKs are available for iOS, Android, Java, Javascript, Python, C++ and more can be checked [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-sdks.html). More details comes below.
     - On the last day, June 19th (Friday) JST, at a TBD time an online pitch event will be hosted where finalists present their works with demos such that everyone with an pre-registered Aroma Shooter will be able to smell the scents that finalist smell. We call that **the world's first scent data livestreaming**. 
     - Six finalists and each remote judges will be provided with one Aroma Shooter and a set of cartridges. All set of cartridges are identical. The number of cartridges of each set will be determined later but no less than six.
